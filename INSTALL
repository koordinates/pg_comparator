* PostgreSQL

With version 8.0 or better, simply use the pgxs GNU makefile provided:

	sh> make install


You must only insure that the "pg_config" found in your path is the one
of the target postgresql server, and that development packages are installed.

Then load the needed extensions (casts, checksum functions, xor aggregate):

	sh> cat pgc_*.sql xor_aggregate.sql | psql ...

To uninstall, do:

	sh> make uninstall


* MySQL

You need "mysql_config" and the development packages.

	sh> make mysql_install

Then load the needed extensions (casts, checksum functions):

	sh> cat mysql_*.sql | mysql ...
        # under Ubuntu this requires appending "/usr/lib/mysql/plugin/* rm,"
        # to "/etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.mysqld" and restarting apparmor.

To uninstall, do:

   	sh> make mysql_uninstall
